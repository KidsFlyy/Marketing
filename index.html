      <p>
        As a parent, it's next to impossible to fly if you have multiple kids.
        Holding a baby while trying to carry your own luggage, the baby's
        luggage, the toddler's luggage, the carseat, the stroller, etc. is
        physically impossible. KidsFly alerts airport staff when you arrive to
        have an airport employee ready at the curb when you arrive.

        <p>
          Flying with young children can be a challenge. Has this
          ever happened to you? You arrive either late or with only a few minutes to spare,
          and you now have to juggle a million things.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are thinking there is no way you are making this flight and you
          just want to give up.
