      <p>
        As a parent, it's next to impossible to fly if you have multiple kids.
        Holding a baby while trying to carry your own luggage, the baby's
        luggage, the toddler's luggage, the carseat, the stroller, etc. is
        physically impossible. KidsFly alerts airport staff when you arrive to
        have an airport employee ready at the curb when you arrive.

        <p>
          As a parent flying with young children can be a challenge, has this
          ever happened to you? You arrive either late or when you only have a
          few mintues to get to the gate, and you now have to juggle a million
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are thinking there is no way you are making this flight and you
          just want to give up.

          With KidsFly you can now set up your trip and alert airport staff
          you are on the way. Then when you get to the airport instead of
          worrying about everything you just worry about your kids. The
          airport staff will be there to basically give you an extra hand.
